# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on initializing the Memory Bank template with core documentation files. This includes setting up the foundational structure and creating initial versions of all required files.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` as the foundation document
- Created `productContext.md` to define why the project exists
- Created `systemPatterns.md` to document architecture and patterns
- Created `techContext.md` to document technical details
- Created this `activeContext.md` file to track current state
- Will create `progress.md` to track project status
- Will create `.clinerules` to capture project intelligence

## Next Steps
1. Complete the initialization of all core Memory Bank files
2. Review the documentation structure for completeness
3. Prepare for first actual project use
4. Establish documentation update workflows
5. Begin capturing project-specific patterns in `.clinerules`

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Documentation Completeness
- **Decision Needed**: Determine what level of detail is appropriate for initial documentation
- **Consideration**: Balance between comprehensive documentation and avoiding premature specificity
- **Current Approach**: Focus on establishing the structure with reasonable initial content that can be refined over time

### Update Frequency
- **Decision Needed**: Establish guidelines for how often each document should be updated
- **Consideration**: Different documents have different update cadences
- **Current Approach**: 
  - `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`: Update with each significant task
  - Other core files: Update when relevant aspects change
  - `.clinerules`: Update continuously as patterns emerge

### Integration with Development
- **Decision Needed**: How to integrate Memory Bank updates with development workflow
- **Consideration**: Documentation should not slow down development but must remain current
- **Current Approach**: Update documentation as part of task completion, not as a separate activity

## Current Questions
- What specific project will this Memory Bank template be used for first?
- Are there any project-specific sections that should be added to the core files?
- What validation process should be used to ensure documentation quality?
- How will we measure the effectiveness of the Memory Bank in practice?

## Recent Insights
- The hierarchical structure provides a clear reading path for quick context recovery
- Separating factual documentation from learned patterns (in `.clinerules`) provides flexibility
- Mermaid diagrams significantly enhance understanding of relationships between components
- The Memory Bank concept could be valuable beyond the specific use case of memory resets
