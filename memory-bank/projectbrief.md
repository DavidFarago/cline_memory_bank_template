# Project Brief

## Overview
This project is a Memory Bank template designed to maintain comprehensive documentation for Cline, an expert software engineer whose memory resets completely between sessions. The Memory Bank serves as Cline's sole source of project knowledge and context after each reset.

## Core Requirements
1. Maintain a structured documentation system that preserves all critical project knowledge
2. Enable Cline to quickly understand the project state after memory resets
3. Document project goals, context, patterns, and progress in a clear, accessible format
4. Provide a framework for continuous documentation updates as the project evolves

## Goals
- Create a self-contained knowledge repository that eliminates the need for repetitive explanations
- Ensure documentation clarity and completeness to support independent work
- Establish a sustainable documentation workflow that integrates with development
- Minimize knowledge loss between sessions

## Scope
The Memory Bank template includes:
- Core documentation files in a structured hierarchy
- Documentation update workflows
- Project intelligence capture system
- Framework for additional context as needed

## Success Criteria
- Cline can resume work effectively after each memory reset
- Documentation remains current and comprehensive
- Project progress continues smoothly despite memory resets
- Reduced need for contextual explanations from users
